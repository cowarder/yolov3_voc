# Yolov3-Pytorch
This repo is the implementation  of my graduation design.

I rewrote the code of Yolov3 and achieved the performance mentioned  in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf)  .

In addition, I proposed an improved [NMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector#Non-maximum_suppression) algorithm that adjust the threshold based on image information and validated it on Pascal Voc 2007 dataset using the Yolov3 model.
