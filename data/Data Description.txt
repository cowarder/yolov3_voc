yolov3.weights: 
	The official weights file is binary file that contains weights stored in a serial fashion.
	The weights are just stored as floats, with nothing to guide us as to which layer do they belong to. 
	The weights belong to only two types of layers, either a batch norm layer or a convolutional layer.
	If a convolutional is followed by a shortcut block, and then the shortcut block by another convolutional block, 
		You will expect file to contain the weights of the previous convolutional block, followed by those of the latter.
	When the batch norm layer appears in a convolutional block, there are no biases. 
		However, when there's no batch norm layer, bias "weights" have to read from the file.
